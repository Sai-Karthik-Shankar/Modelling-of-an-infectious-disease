# Modelling-of-an-infectious-disease

Simulates the spread of an infectious disease using a compartmental model of varying complexity.

### Assumptions
  Models are only as good as the assumptions on which they are based. If a model makes predictions that are out of line with observed results and the mathematics is correct, the     initial assumptions must change to make the model useful.

## SIR Model
  In 1927, W. O. Kermack and A. G. McKendrick created a model in which they considered a fixed population with only three compartments: susceptible, S(t); infected, I(t); and       recovered, R(t). The compartments used for this model consist of three classes:
## SEIRD Model
  For many important infections, there is a significant incubation period during which individuals have been infected but are not yet infectious themselves. During this period the individual is in compartment E (for exposed). Categorises the total population into Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I), Recovered (R), and Dead (D)\
## SEIRSD Model
  Model that simulates an infectious disease with partial Immunity and categorises the total population into Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I), Recovered (R), Susceptible   (S) and Dead (D)
