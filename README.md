# Modelling-of-an-infectious-disease

Simulates the spread of an infectious disease using a compartmental model of varying complexity.

# SIR Model
This is a simple model that shows the chunk of poplulation that are Susceptible (S), Infected (I), and Removed (R)\
# SEIRD Model
Model that categorises the total population into Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I), Recovered (R), and Dead (D)\
# SEIRSD Model
Model that simulates an infectious disease with partial Immunity and categorises the total population into Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I), Recovered (R), Susceptible (S) and Dead (D)\
